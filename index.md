My name is Katie Ball, and I’m a designer with a penchant for the web, interaction design, and typography. I like [scratching my own itch](/portfolio) and [writing](/blog) about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I’m currently working in Melbourne for [Roach Haus](http://roachhaus.com) as a Designer, trying to make things make sense. If you want to, you can view and download [my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mektball).
